macvim-skim
===========

Tools for integrating macvim with Skim.app.  Adds shortcuts to vim so that you
can go to the current line in the PDF from a tex document.  Adds a tool to Skim
so that shift-command-clicking on a line brings you to that line in the source code.

Example:
![Screenshot example of intended environment](https://raw.github.com/keflavich/macvim-skim/master/macvim-skim/test/Example_MacvimSkim.png "Screenshot")

Shortcuts:
 * `<leader>v` - view current .tex file in Skim at current line
 * `<leader>p` - rebuild current .tex file with `pdflatex -synctex=1`, then active Skim at current line
 * `<leader>m` - Run the command `make` in the current directory, then activate Skim at current line
 * `<leader>r` - activate Skim at current line, then bring vim back to the front
 * `<leader>t` - `<leader>p` + `<leader>r`: rebuild current file, then bring vim back to the front

From Skim:
 * `Shift`-`Command`-click on a line to go to that line in the `.tex` file


INSTALLATION
------------
Easiest way: run `macvim-skim-install.sh`.  By default, installs a shell script
to your `$HOME/bin/` directory, installs `Skim.app` version 1.4.1 if Skim is not already
installed, and puts `WhichTab.vim` in your plugins directory.  It will also add
the shortcut lines to your `$HOME/.vimrc`.

### INSTALLATION OPTIONS ###

Variables used in installation process:
 * `PREFIX`  (default `$HOME/bin`)
 * `VIMDIR`  (default `$HOME/.vim/`)
 * `SKIMPATH` (default `/Applications/Skim.app`)

If you want to specify a different install directory for the executable file, specify the
`PREFIX` variable, e.g.:
`PREFIX=/usr/local ./macvim-skim-install.sh`

You can also specify the path to `Skim.app` with the variable `SKIMPATH`.  If
you do not use the default `/Applications/Skim.app`, you'll need to set the vim
variable `g:macvim_skim_app_path` in your `~/.vimrc` (this step has been
removed from the automatic installation, as I don't think install scripts
should modify your `.vimrc`)

### Manual Install ###
If you want to install manually, Copy macvim-skim to `~/.vim/plugins/`.  Put
`macvim-load-line` on your path.
